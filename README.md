# VOIS-power-bi

This project was developed as part of my internship at VOIS. The goal of the project was to perform Data Analysis on the CarDekho Dataset and build an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard offers insights into car data such as production year, fuel type, transmission type, and profitability.
